					<h1> About us </h1>
				
					<p>  Blossom &amp; Bloom is a locally and family owned flora design company in Fresno, California. This company was created by Stephanie Kubo. She has always had an eye for floral design and a passion for beautiful, fresh flowers! During COVID–19 quarantine, she made the decision that she wanted to start this business to help brighten up people's day. She started by creating floral arrangements and working with a home health company. Every day she would create over 15 different arrangements, and have them delivered to all of the patient's homes. We aim for 100% satisfaction and love being able to make someone's day better. Make sure to call us for all of life's occasions and special moments!   </p>
